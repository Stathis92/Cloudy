 Our little friend fell from the sky and requires your help to climb back home.

 Project description:
 The goal of this little project was to experiment a bit with mobile game developement.
 Some key struggles I faced were Input lag / Sound delay / Save&Load system / Rewarded Advertisements.

 I'm happy with the results and I feel the game has some good structure if I ever wanted to complete it.
 Other than coding I also placed a challenge for myself to do all the graphics/art too.
